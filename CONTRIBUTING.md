# Contibuting to HelioDB

Thank you for your interest in contributing to HelioDB. There are several ways and means through which contributions to the project can be made and you can get involved.

## Asking Questions

Follow us on Discord and engage with our team directly for any questions you may have, and we will be happy to help. In addition, our community will be a great forum to raise questions and discuss ideas for and about the project.

## Reporting Issues

Before a new issue is created for a bug or feature request, please check the list of open issues to avoid multiple issues being created for the same bug or feature. If one already exists, add a reaction and relevant comments for additional clarity if needed.

## How to Contribute

We request that you file a single issue per problem or feature request to maximize highlighting the issue.

The more descriptive the issue is and the more information that can be provided, the more helpful it will be to the community and the contributors to pick up the issue.

Please include the following with each issue:

* The operating system on which HelioDB was run to discover the issue

* A set of detailed reproducible steps that lead to the issue

* The expected results versus the results or failures that were seen

* A code snippet that reproduces the issues or an accessible repository that can be cloned, built, and run to reproduce the issue

## Pull Requests

Before a pull request is accepted, you will need to sign a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com/), an automated process that is triggered by a bot and only needed once. If you have previously signed the CLA, the status check turns green instantly. If you are yet to sign the CLA, a comment is added with more information and instructions on how to sign the CLA.

For the smoothest and fastest turnaround time, we request that a single pull request be created along with a link to a previously created issue describing the bug or feature request.

Wherever applicable, pull requests should contain tests.

## Suggestions

Weâ€™re keen to hear your feedback on the future of HelioDB. Feature Requests can be submitted through the issue tracker. To ensure suggestions are reviewed faster, we do request that the following information be provided for each suggestion:

* Purpose/Motivation for the feature

* Description of the problem space that will be solved or addressed by this feature

* Description of a few scenarios that will help test and validate this feature

## Discussion Etiquette

To provide all members of the community with a safe space for contributions and discussions, we request that comments always be courteous and respectful of others.
